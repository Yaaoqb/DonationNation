# DonationNation
successfully designed and developed a cloud-based donation platform called "Donation Nation" using C# and Visual Studio Professional. By leveraging various AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk, RDS SQL Server, S3, SNS, CloudFront, and X-Ray, created a user-friendly interface and enhanced the overall user experience. The implementation of AWS SNS allowed for automated SMS notifications to be sent to users, ensuring they were informed about upcoming events. Additionally, utilized AWS CloudFront to optimize access latency and monitored system performance using AWS X-Ray, gaining valuable insights. The Donation Nation project exemplifies my skills in cloud application design and development, highlighting my ability to leverage AWS services to create efficient and user-centric solutions.
